RainLisp Console allows you to run the programs you write in [RainLisp](https://github.com/chr1st0scli/RainLisp).

It can be used in three ways:

- In REPL mode (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) that allows you to evaluate code incrementally.
- As a code editor with syntax highlighting, basic code completion, source code file management and code evaluation.
- As a tool with command line arguments that allows the interpreter to be used with other editors or tools.

## Installation
You need to have .NET 6 or later installed.

Run the following command in a command line shell to download RainLispConsole from Nuget and install it as a global tool.
```
dotnet tool install -g RainLispConsole --version 1.0.0-alpha002
```

## Usage
Run the following command.
